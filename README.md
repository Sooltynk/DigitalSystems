Digital logic circuits can be classified into “combinational” and “sequential”. A combinational logic circuit is one whose output solely depends on its current inputs. sequential circuits, on the other hand, are built using combinational circuits and memory elements called “flip-flops”. Digital logic circuits can be classified into “combinational” and “sequential”. A combinational logic circuit is one whose output solely depends on its current inputs. sequential circuits, on the other hand, are built using combinational circuits and memory elements called “flip-flops”. In this repository, I have a combinational circuit project and a sequential circuit project carried out for this subject documented in Catalan.
